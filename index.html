        <h2>Senior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Senior at Bob Jones University studying Accounting with a minor in graphic design. I work for Aramark in the Den, as the sole janitor cleaning the place.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in target shooting competitions and I build 1:10 Radio Controlled race cars for carpet, tramac, and dirt tracks on the side.  I help teach Sunday School for the 2-3yr olds @ my church Fellowship Baptist in Boise, ID. &amp; 
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy playing video games with friends, and a good camping trip in the McCall Valley.
